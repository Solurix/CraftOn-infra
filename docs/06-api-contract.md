# 06 — API Contract (Phase 1)

REST + JSON, served by FastAPI. Base path `/api/v1`. Auth via a bearer token in
`Authorization: Bearer <token>` — normally an **API session token** issued by
login/registration; at registration only, a **Firebase OTP token**. The API verifies it
and loads the `users` row. FastAPI auto-generates OpenAPI at `/docs` — that is the
**authoritative** schema; this file is the human overview, keep them in sync.

Conventions: snake_case JSON; money integer JPY; timestamps ISO-8601 UTC; errors as
`{ "error": { "code": "...", "message": "..." } }` with appropriate HTTP status.

## Auth & session
| Method | Path | Role | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| POST | `/auth/session` | valid OTP token | Register on first login (verifies the OTP token; sets username/email/password) or return the existing user. Returns an API session token on creation. |
| POST | `/auth/login` | public | Returning login: identifier (username/email/phone) + password → API session token. No OTP. |
| POST | `/auth/password` | self (active) | Set/replace own password. |
| POST | `/auth/reset-password` | valid OTP token | Forgot-password: re-verify phone by OTP, set a new password, return a session token. |
| PATCH | `/me/account` | self (active) | Change own login identifiers (username / email). |
| GET | `/me` | any | Current user + profile + status |

> SMS OTP (handled by Firebase on the client) is required **only at registration and
> password reset** to prove phone ownership. Returning logins use identifier + password
> and the API issues its own signed session token (ADR 0009). Phone stays the canonical
> identity.

## Onboarding & profiles
| Method | Path | Role | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| POST | `/onboarding/worker` | worker | Create/complete worker profile |
| POST | `/onboarding/contractor` | contractor | Create/complete contractor profile |
| GET | `/workers/{id}` | any approved | Public worker profile (reviews, trust, trades) |
| GET | `/contractors/{id}` | any approved | Public contractor profile (rating, reviews) |
| PATCH | `/workers/me` | worker | Edit own profile |
| PATCH | `/contractors/me` | contractor | Edit own profile |

Notes:
- `display_name` is optional everywhere. Signup no longer collects it; on first
  onboarding the API defaults it to the worker's name / the contractor's
  `company_name` (still editable via the PATCH endpoints).
- Worker names are structured: `family_name` / `given_name` / `middle_name`
  (middle optional); `full_name` is composed family-first on write.
- Worker `work_history` entries are `{company, trade, years, description}` —
  `description` is a free-text summary (概要) of the work done there.

## Trades catalog
| Method | Path | Role | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/trades` | any signed-in | Active trades for the pickers (ja canonical + en label) |

| PATCH | `/admin/trades/{id}` | admin | Rename (rewrites stored occurrences) / toggle active / reorder |
| GET | `/admin/trades/custom` | admin | User-invented free-text trade values + usage counts |
| POST | `/admin/trades/merge` | admin | Rewrite a free-text value to a canonical trade on all profiles/jobs (deduplicated) |

## Documents (upload & vetting)
| Method | Path | Role | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| POST | `/documents/upload-url` | worker/contractor | Get a signed Cloud Storage upload URL |
| POST | `/documents` | worker/contractor | Register an uploaded doc (type, path) |
| GET | `/documents/me` | owner | List own docs + review status |
| GET | `/documents/{id}/view-url` | owner or admin | Short-lived signed read URL for a doc's bytes (photo display / vetting) |

## Jobs
| Method | Path | Role | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| POST | `/jobs` | contractor | Post a job (validates service area) |
| GET | `/jobs/{id}/photos` | any approved | Signed read URLs for a posting's attached photos |

| GET | `/jobs/{id}/applications` | owner contractor | List applicants |
| POST | `/applications/{id}/confirm` | owner contractor | Confirm worker → creates matching (sets contract_type, platform_fee) |
| POST | `/applications/{id}/reject` | owner contractor | Reject applicant |
| POST | `/applications/{id}/withdraw` | worker | Withdraw |

| POST | `/matchings/{id}/complete-request` | worker | Worker marks work done |
| POST | `/matchings/{id}/approve-completion` | contractor | Approve → `completed`, record fee owed |
| POST | `/matchings/{id}/cancel` | participant | Cancel (records reason; `noshow` is admin/auto in P2) |

## Chat
| Method | Path | Role | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/matchings/{id}/messages` | participant | Fetch messages |
| POST | `/matchings/{id}/messages` | participant | Send message — **server applies contact-mask filter**; rejects/flags blocked content |

> Real-time delivery may use Firestore listeners on the client; the POST endpoint remains
> the authoritative write path enforcing masking. See `08-compliance-legal.md`.

## Validation rules to enforce server-side (Phase 1)
- Service-area check on job post (config; can be disabled).
- Non-JP worker: cannot be `approved` / confirmed without residence card + valid visa.
- `freelance` worker with `has_insurance=false`: block confirmation (config-toggleable).
- Contact-mask filter on every outgoing message.
- Reviews only after `completed`; one per direction; participants only.
- State-machine guards on matching status transitions.
